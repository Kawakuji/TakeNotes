# Privacy Policy for TakeNote

**Effective Date:** 2024-01-01

At TakeNote, your privacy isn't just a policy; it's the core of our architecture. We believe you should have complete ownership and control over your data.

## 1. Local-First Principle

TakeNote is a **"local-first"** application. This means that **all of your data is stored exclusively on your own device** within your web browser's secure storage (IndexedDB).

## 2. No Data Transmission

We are committed to your privacy. Therefore:

- **We DO NOT collect, store, or process any of your personal data on our servers.** We don't have servers that store user content.
- **Your notes, tags, folders, attachments, and settings NEVER leave your device.**
- **There are NO analytics, NO tracking pixels, and NO third-party data-sharing services integrated into this application.**

The application does not require an internet connection to function after the initial load. It is designed to work completely offline.

## 3. Your Data, Your Control

You have 100% control over your data at all times.

- You can view all your data within the application.
- You can export all your data at any time using the "Export Data" feature, which packages your notes and attachments into a single `.qnote` file that you can store wherever you wish.
- You can delete your data permanently. Deleting a note, folder, or the entire database from your browser's site settings will remove it forever.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

Because our privacy principle is fundamental to how the app is built, this policy is unlikely to change. If we ever introduce features that could impact this policy (like optional, end-to-end encrypted cloud sync), we will ask for your explicit consent before enabling them.

If you have any questions about this policy, please open an issue in the project's repository.
